You are given an integer array nums with the following properties:

nums.length == 2 * n.
nums contains n + 1 unique elements.
Exactly one element of nums is repeated n times.
Return the element that is repeated n times.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,2,5,3,2]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 5000
nums.length == 2 * n
0 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains n + 1 unique elements and one of them is repeated exactly n times.
